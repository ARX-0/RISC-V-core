# RISC-V-core

I'm currently working on creating a RISC-V processor.
Currently /src is an empty directry but I am now posting current progress versions in /practice-files.

## Current progress

/ver1: This core can execute add.

/ver2: This core can execute almost all of the rv32i instructions (not tested yet)

/ver3: Start implementing easy memory using registers (plan to make fibonacci executable)
